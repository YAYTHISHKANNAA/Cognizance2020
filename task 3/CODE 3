Algorithm and pseudocode o find Greatest of three numbers.

ALGORITHM

Step 1: Start.
Step 2: Read the value of the three numbers A,B,C.
Step 3: If A>B is true then check whether A>C if it is also true then display that A                  is the greatest number or display that C is the greatest number.
Step 4: Now if A>B is false then check whether B>C is also false then display that C is the greatest number or display that B is the greatest number.
Step 5: Stop.

PSEUDOCODE

BEGIN
GET A,B,C
IF A>B AND A>C THEN
  PRINT A
ELSE B>C THEN
  PRINT B
ELSE 
  PRINT C
ENDIF
END
